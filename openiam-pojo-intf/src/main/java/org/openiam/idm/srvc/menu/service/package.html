Navigator Service provides dynamic menuing to an application. Menu options are stored in the database 
and are associated to either systems 'guests' or groups. Using this information 
the navigator component is able to appropriate menu or navigation options for 
the web site or application based on how you are. In guest mode, the navigator 
provides access to all the public areas of a web site. Similarly, in Authenticated 
mode, the user is granted access to the options they have been granted access 
to through the security mechanism. Another feature of the Navigator is that each 
menu options can be associated with an action. </font>
